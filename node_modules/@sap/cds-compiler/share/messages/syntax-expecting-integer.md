# syntax-expecting-integer

The compiler expects a safe integer here.
The last safe integer is `2^53 - 1` or `9007199254740991`.

A safe integer is an integer that fulfills all of the following:

- Can be exactly represented as an IEEE-754 double precision number.
- The IEEE-754 representation cannot be the result of rounding any
  other integer to fit the IEEE-754 representation.

The message's severity is `Error`.

## Example

Erroneous code example:

<!-- cds-mode: ignore -->
```cds
type LengthIsUnsafe : String(9007199254740992);
type NotAnInteger : String(42.1);
```

In the erroneous example, the string length for the type `LengthIsUnsafe` is
not a safe integer. It is too large.
Likewise, the string length for the type `NotAnInteger` is a decimal.

## How to Fix

You have to provide a safe integer:

```cds
type LengthIsSafe : String(9007199254740991);
type AnInteger : String(42);
```

If it's not feasible to use a safe integer, a string representation of the
number needs to be used, for example, in annotation values.
